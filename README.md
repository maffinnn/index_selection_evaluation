This repository contains my work for the final year project in fulfilment of the graduating requirement from Nanynag Technological University, Singapore.

The experiments are done in the file: DISTILL.ipynb while the model training is done in train.py

The trained model is saved at saved_model_stat_dict_copy.pt
